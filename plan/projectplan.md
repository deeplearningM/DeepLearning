# C++ Course Project Plan

__"Project plan
Project plan is a PDF document describing the scope of the project, major architectural decisions, preliminary schedule, design rationale and so on.The document should be roughly five pages long, with a couple of diagrams illustrating the program design (for example, the planned class relationships).

Project plan must be put in the Git repository in the plan/ directory. You don't need to tag the revision, it is enough that the plan is found in the plan directory.

The project plan deadline is on Monday, November 14. You will receive feedback about your project plan from your group's advisor.

Do not overplan the project. Have an idea of the high level structure (e.g. high-level class hierarchy) and of potential algorithms to use for problematic parts, but do not go into details at this phase. It is not uncommon that plans change during implementation of the project for various reasons (improved understanding of the problem, possible changes in group composition, etc.), and this is fine."__

Esa Koskinen, Simo Muraja, Olli Kauppinen, Jussi Hirvonen

### Project goals and preliminary scope

(mit채 ollaan tekem채ss채, ja miten, ja miten hyvin)
(skele aihe)

### Basic architecture and main ASRs

(yleispiirteinen kuvaus arkkitehtuurista; diagrammi)
(architecturally significant requirementsien identifiointi ja pohdintaa)
(design rationale, separation of concerns in architecture)
(luokkaryhmien jako; eeeehk채 jonkin abstraktiotason luokkadiagrammi?)

### Preliminary schedule and responsibilities

(general responsibilities by group members; which parts will be shared)
(some preliminary goals, say, for every two weeks)

### Working practices

(coding practices and appropriate git usage)
(I would vouch for having a release candidate devbranch before pushing things into master, and then individual working branches from that)
(I would be willing to try serious TDD, CI, or similar things as an excercise in semi-professional development thinking too, if there is an appropriate and easy to learn framework available for doing that in C++)
(Maybe something like unified TODO and commit message practices as well? I think the thing we did with Jussi in WSD would work here)
(At the very least, please don't merge broken code, and please please do something to avoid messy merge conflicts where possible?)
(communication channels)
(weekly meetings?)

(remember to make .pdf)
