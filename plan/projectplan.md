### C++ Course Project Plan

# Authors:

# Project goals and preliminary scope

(mit채 ollaan tekem채ss채, ja miten, ja miten hyvin)
(skele aihe)

# Basic architecture and main ASRs

(yleispiirteinen kuvaus arkkitehtuurista; diagrammi)
(architecturally significant requirementsien identifiointi ja pohdintaa)
(design rationale, separation of concerns in architecture)
(luokkaryhmien jako; eeeehk채 jonkin abstraktiotason luokkadiagrammi?)

# Preliminary schedule and responsibilities

(general responsibilities by group members; which parts will be shared)
(some preliminary goals, say, for every two weeks)

# Working practices

(coding practices and appropriate git usage)
(I would vouch for having a release candidate devbranch before pushing things into master, and then individual working branches from that)
(communication)
(weekly meetings?)

"Project plan
Project plan is a PDF document describing the scope of the project, major architectural decisions, preliminary schedule, design rationale and so on.The document should be roughly five pages long, with a couple of diagrams illustrating the program design (for example, the planned class relationships).

Project plan must be put in the Git repository in the plan/ directory. You don't need to tag the revision, it is enough that the plan is found in the plan directory.

The project plan deadline is on Monday, November 14. You will receive feedback about your project plan from your group's advisor.

Do not overplan the project. Have an idea of the high level structure (e.g. high-level class hierarchy) and of potential algorithms to use for problematic parts, but do not go into details at this phase. It is not uncommon that plans change during implementation of the project for various reasons (improved understanding of the problem, possible changes in group composition, etc.), and this is fine."
