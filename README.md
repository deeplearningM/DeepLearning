### qlearning2 README

This repository contains three subdirectories:

* plan/ for the plan
* doc/  for the final documentation
* src/  for all the source code

The project a reinforcement learning implementation done during the C++ programming course held at Aalto University. It involves running a physics-based car through a racetrack with a neural network. The network then learns how to complete laps on the track as fast as possible. The project is far from perfect, but was a valuable learning experience.

The Box2D library is built for 64-bit systems, this shouldn't be a problem.
